# PacMan Websocket

this is only an initial experiment with websockets, the code is from the tutorial by
[kubowania](https://github.com/kubowania/pac-man)

I have implemented a solution for remote control with another client of the game.

## Getting Started

Install dependecies 

`npm install` or `yarn`

Run dev server

`npm start` or `yarn start`
